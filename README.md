# VueJS-and-CFML
Slides and Code samples from my talk "Connecting Vue.js and CFML with ColdBox"

There are several things in this 1 repo:

/SampleDatabase is a small Percona database for some of the demos.
You'll need Docker to get that running. There is a small cheat sheet in 
that folder to show you the commands.  So just install Docker, and run
the commmands in /SampleDataBase/README.txt and you should be all set.

Or, if you're not a fan of Docker, you can just grab the SQL here:

/SampleDatabase/devsetup/create-popculturedb.sql

and run that on whatever your favorite database is.
